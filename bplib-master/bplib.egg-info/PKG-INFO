Description: The ``bplib`` is a library implementing support for computations on groups supporting 
        bilinear pairings, as used in modern cryptography. 
        
        It is based on the OpenPairing library by 
        Diego Aranha (https://github.com/dfaranha/OpenPairing), which is itself based on, and compatible 
        with, OpenSSL math functions (``bn`` and ``ec``). The ``bplib`` is compatible with ``petlib`` types
        including ``petlib.bn`` and the group G1 is a ``petlib.ec`` EC group. Along with ``petlib``, 
        they provide easy to use 
        support for maths and ciphers used in modern Privacy Enhancing Technologies."
        
        A set of bilinear EC groups is defined as:
        
            >>> G = bp.BpGroup()
        
        Such a BpGroup describes 3 groups G1, G2 and GT such that pair(G1,G2)->GT. Generators 
        for the groups G1 and G2 are denoted by:
        
        	>>> g1, g2 = G.gen1(), G.gen2()
        
        The special ``pair`` operation computes to pairing into GT:
        
        	>>> gt = G.pair(g1, g2)
        
        Operations are defined on all elements of G1, G2 or GT in a natural additive infix notation for G1 and G2, and a multiplicative notation for GT:
            
            >>> gt6 = gt**6
        
        As expected the ``pair`` operations is additive:
        
            >>> G.pair(g1, 6*g2) == gt6
            True
            >>> G.pair(6*g1, g2) == gt6
            True
            >>> G.pair(2*g1, 3*g2) == gt6
            True
